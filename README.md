# ProjetAssuranceQualite
Student Grades Management System
Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to create classes to represent students, courses, and grades:

Student Class (Etudiant)
Course Class (Cours)
Grades Class (Notes)
Throughout this project, you may encounter new tools. Although learning them might be initially frustrating, they will ultimately save you time.

Tasks:
Task 1: Student Class (Etudiant)

Each student is identified by:
Student Number
Last Name
First Name
Task 2: Course Class (Cours)

Each course is identified by:
Course Number
Code
Title
Task 3: Grades Class (Notes)

Each grade is identified by:
Student Number
Course Number
Grade
Application Requirements:
You are required to build an application that allows for:

Creating and displaying students, courses, and grades
Entering grades for students
Saving data into a text file for each student
Displaying a student’s grade report in real-time when the student number is entered
Recommended Tools:
Programming Language: C# is recommended for ease of development.
Framework: WinForms application is suggested, but you may use any programming language.
Project Validation:
Students are expected to work with Git and GitHub.
Create a personal branch and push your work to it.
The final submission should include all necessary files for the project, especially the source code.
Programming Standards:
Identifiers:

Class and interface names should start with an uppercase letter.
Method and variable names should start with a lowercase letter, except constructors.
Use camelCase for identifiers with multiple words.
Constants should be in uppercase with underscores as word separators.
Methods should begin with a verb in camelCase.
Accessor methods should follow the naming convention: getAttribute, setAttribute, isAttributeEqualTo(value).
Variables:

Only declare variables that are used.
Avoid unnecessary memory allocations.
Do not use the same variable for different purposes.
Differentiate between instance and local variables.
Program Structure:

Structure your programs clearly with well-defined interfaces and decomposed algorithms.
Input/Output:

Provide prompts for user input.
Validate input and handle exceptions.
Generate a text file for each student containing all their information.
Print the file’s content when the student number is entered.
Code Quality and Error Handling:
Your code will be evaluated based on:

Validity and correctness
Code clarity and quality
Error handling
Each part of your solution, such as each method, will be individually assessed against the requirements. The main program (main method) should be designed to catch logical errors.
